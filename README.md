# Spree Extension: Product Translations
This extension allows you to translate product details on an intuitive way based on tabs.
Currently it will load tabs for all locales in `I18n.available_locales`.

Prepared for Spree 0.70.1 and Rails 3.1

Its inspired and started from:

[Fabien](https://github.com/fabien) fork of [spree-simple_product_translations](https://github.com/fabien/spree-simple_product_translations) in the 3.1 branch
[Fabien](https://github.com/fabien) fork of [spree-product_translations](https://github.com/fabien/spree-product_translations)

Both original from [jeroenj](https://github.com/jeroenj)
